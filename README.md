### Advent of Code 2021 solutions

See: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Two programming puzzles a day from Dec 1 to Christmas. I limited myself to `numpy` and the Python core modules, and I also tried to solve the problems without looking anything up on the internet. (Code and documentation inspection---e.g. `help` or `?`---were allowed.) I did _not_ worry about finding the most elegant or efficient solution or writing particularly clean code, just getting there quickly.
